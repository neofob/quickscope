This directory contains test programs build with autotools.
You must run the ../configure script with the --enable-tests
to build these test programs.  These test programs are not
necessarily good quickscope user example programs.

For good short and long user example programs see the files
in directory ../examples that came with the quickscope source
tarball or the quickscope source git repository files.  The
examples in ../examples do not use GNU autotools to build, but
instead use a single makefile (GNUmakefile) and assumes that
the quickscope library is installed.
