This directory contains example programs that build with an installed
quickscope package and does not use GNU autotools to build.  You will need
the pkg-config to be able to get libquickscope installation information,
maybe by setting the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include the
directory where quickscope.pc is installed.  For example in a bash shell


   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/joe/installed/lib/pkgconfig


given that the quickscope installation prefix was /home/joe/installed




Try running: ./demo_launcher


Or try:
      
      make
      ./sin



The simplest coded example to start with is sin.c which is made into the
sin program in this directory.  ./demo_launcher runs make for you.


To make your own example:

  1. copy an existing .c file to MY_EXAMPLE.c
  2. edit MY_EXAMPLE.c
  3. run 'make' or './demo_launcher'

Your new example will now by in the demo_launcher run list until you
remove MY_EAXMPLE.c and run 'make' or './demo_launcher'.


Note:  These example use a GNU make file with GNU make extensions, so
that's why the make file is called GNUmakefile.  See
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefile-Names.html
for more about GNU make make-file naming conventions.
