Example source code is from simplest starting in C source file name
00_*.c to more complex higher file name number prefix.  If you look at
the C source files in that order you just might get an understanding.  The
C source filename number prefixes are ordered but not necessarily
sequential, so that as examples are added the filenames do not have to
change so much.


This directory contains example programs that build with an installed
quickscope package and does not use GNU autotools to build.  You will need
the pkg-config to be able to get libquickscope installation information,
maybe by setting the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include the
directory where quickscope.pc is installed.  For example: in a bash shell


   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/joe/installed/lib/pkgconfig


given that the quickscope installation prefix was /home/joe/installed



Try running: ./demo_launcher


Or try:
      
      make
      ./sin



The simplest coded example to start with is sin.c which is made into the
sin program in this directory.  ./demo_launcher runs make for you.


To make your own example:

  1. copy an existing .c file to MY_EXAMPLE.c
  2. edit MY_EXAMPLE.c
  3. run 'make' or './demo_launcher'

Your new example will now by in the demo_launcher run list until you
remove MY_EAXMPLE.c and run 'make' or './demo_launcher'.


These example are intended to be simple so as to aid users writing any
kind of quickscope program, be it complex or simple.  We feel that a 1000
line hello world program is not as useful as a 10 line hello world
program.  If you want more complexity look at the programs in ../bin.  How
do ya like that, they are not complex either.  Guess you better write the
complex quickscope program yourself.


Note:  These example use a GNU make file with GNU make extensions, so
that's why the make file is called GNUmakefile.  See
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefile-Names.html
for more about GNU make make-file naming conventions.
