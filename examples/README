This directory contains example programs that build with
an installed quickscope package and does not use GNU autotools
to build.  You will need the pkg-config to be able to get
libquickscope installation information, maybe by setting the
environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include the directory
where quickscope.pc in installed.  For example in a bash shell


   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/joe/installed/lib/pkgconfig


given that the quickscope installation prefix was
/home/joe/installed

Run make:


    make


and then run a program like:


    ./sin


for example.

The simplest coded example to start with is sin.c
